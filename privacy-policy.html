             <h4>6.1 General provisions</h4>
            <p>Where TalkChief is the Data Controller of Personal Data (for example, Personal Data relating to the Site visitors, or individuals who register to use our Services), then we retain the Personal Data we collect where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide them with our Services, to enable their participation in an event, and to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process Personal Data, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>If Personal Data is processed for, on behalf of, or for the purpose of the Services taken out by, any Subscriber, we will process Personal Data for as long as we are instructed to do so by the relevant Subscriber that is the Data Controller of such Personal Data.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Personal Data shall be stored for the duration of Your use of the Services as well as for the different renewal periods, and for the purposes listed above.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>We may retain Personal Data to comply with Our legal or regulatory obligations. In any case, upon ceasing or lifting of such obligations, Personal Data shall be removed from our systems and records, as well as that of our subcontractors, if any, or otherwise archived or anonymized so that they can no longer be identified.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>6.2 Provisions specific to credit / debit card and bank account details</h4>

                <p>Personal Data may be transferred, accessed to and stored in a country located outside the EEA. Personal Data can also be processed by individuals working outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) who work for Us or for one of Our trusted service providers, such as Our hosting providers (Amazon). In any case, Personal Data are only transferred in a secure manner and in compliance with the applicable regulations. As some countries may not have laws governing the use and transfer of Personal Data, we undertake to take all necessary steps to ensure that third parties comply with the terms and conditions set out in this Privacy Policy. These measures may include controlling the standards applied by such third parties with respect to Personal Data protection and security, and/or the execution of appropriate agreements to deal with such transfers (e.g. the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission of the European Union).

                <p>If we have received Personal Data under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third-party service provider for processing, we will remain responsible if they process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
