            <p>In addition to the above restrictions and in order to provide the best pricing, support and Services, TalkChief reserves the right to: (i) impose limits on Customer and/or its Users’ usage of the Services; (ii) charge Customer the applicable per minute rate; (iii) or to terminate the Services, in each case (i) through (iii) notwithstanding Customer’s purchase of an unlimited minute plan, if TalkChief believes, in its sole reasonable discretion, that Customer’s and or its Users’ usage, including, but not limited to, the total number of calls made and/or minutes used by Customer and/or its Users is not consistent with normal, fair, and reasonable use of such Services. Wherever reasonably possible, TalkChief will provide Customer with a written notice before taking any such action, and may allow a reasonable period to allow Customer to modify such use.</p>

            <h3>6. TalkChief Numbers</h3>
            <p>6.1 Usage Rules. As part of the Services, TalkChief may make available TalkChief Numbers to Customer in multiple countries. TalkChief has agreements in place with regulated providers of electronic communications which provide TalkChief with phone numbers from multiple countries. The provision of TalkChief Numbers is subject to the numbering rules and regulatory practices applicable in the countries where Customer and and/or Users are located as well as in the relevant country(ies) from which the TalkChief Numbers were purchased. Such rules and regulatory practices may change or be amended from time to time, and TalkChief therefore reserves the right to modify the terms hereunder to the extent necessary to comply with such changes or amendments. Customer may purchase TalkChief Numbers and assign them to an Account subject to the allocation requirements displayed upon Customer’s subscription to any Services. Customer shall use the TalkChief Numbers in compliance with any and all applicable Law including such applicable allocation requirements. TalkChief reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel the subscribed TalkChief Numbers for any or no reason, including in the event Customer, its Administrators and/or Users breach such applicable allocation requirements without penalty and without prejudice to its rights to claim damages therefore.</p>
            <p>6.2 Portability. In using the Services, Customer may request an TalkChief Number or may port its existing numbers (“Existing Number”) into Customer’s Account subject to the terms and conditions herein. In order to request the porting of an Existing Number into an Account, the Account Administrator for the Account into which Customer wishes the Existing Number to be ported must complete all steps listed on the Site and provide all information requested by TalkChief, any other relevant service provider and/or third party from time to time. Customer must provide accurate and detailed information to TalkChief any other relevant service provider and/or third party in order to port a number into an Account and Customer represents and warrants that such information is and will be at all times </p>

            <p>accurate, true and up-to-date. Customer acknowledges and agrees that as part of the porting process, TalkChief, any other relevant service provider and/or third party must, as part of its compliance with applicable Laws and industry standards, follow certain processes and that therefore the completion of any number porting request may be delayed for reasons outside of TalkChief’s control. TalkChief must, by Law, comply with all valid porting requests. Phone numbers may be ported-out of an Account in connection with acts or omissions of third parties and Customer acknowledges that: (i) it may be impossible for TalkChief to prevent such porting out of numbers from an Account; (ii) TalkChief may not be able to retrieve a phone number ported out of an Account; and (iii) TalkChief shall not be liable for any such porting out. Upon termination or cancelation of an Account, all telephone numbers associated with the Account may be released by TalkChief if such numbers have not been ported to another provider prior to such cancelation or termination. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for coordinating with its new third-party provider to port out any telephone numbers prior to termination or cancellation of Customer’s Account and/or termination of this Agreement.</p>

            <h3>7. Pricing & Invoicing</h3>
            <p>7.1 Free Trial. Customer may elect to try the Services for a period of up to five (5) business days from the Effective Date and shall be permitted to make outbound calls for a total of up to forty (40) minutes (such trial of the Services, the “Free Trial”). At the end of the Free Trial period, Customer may purchase additional products and services not included in the Free Trial by selecting a Plan.</p>
            <p>7.2 Fixed Fees. Customer may select a Plan on a monthly basis or on an annual basis and Customer may also select the corresponding currency for such Plan (either Euros or USD), and unless otherwise provided in the relevant Order Form, the fees associated to such Plan shall be indicated on the Site (such fees, the “Fixed Fees”). Additional TalkChief Numbers purchased by Customer either via the TalkChief Dashboard or listed in the</p>
            <p>relevant Order Form, as applicable shall also be deemed Fixed Fees. For the avoidance of doubt, fees associated with outbound calls or inbound calls (where applicable) shall not be included in the Fixed Fees. Fixed Fees may be updated by TalkChief at any time, and such updated Fixed Fees shall be applicable during the next period of each Plan Term or the Order Form Term, as applicable.</p>
            <p>7.3 Usage Fees. The fees associated with outbound calls or inbound calls, where applicable, shall be calculated by multiplying the per-minute rate applicable to such calls (“Per-Minute Rates”) with the Chargeable Time (as defined below) (such fees, the “Usage Fees”). Telephony usage and the duration of calls shall be calculated as follows: (i) in full-minute increments; (ii) calls shall be rounded up to the next full minute increment at the end of each call for invoicing purposes; (iii) calls will be deemed to begin when a connection to the number Customer is trying to reach is established and recorded in TalkChief’s system, and for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is recorded in TalkChief’s system; (iv) calls will be deemed to end when Customer or Customer’s correspondent have ended the call or where the call has ended due to a technical malfunction, but a call shall not be deemed ended until Customer’s wireless telephone signal of a call disconnect is recorded in the TalkChief system; (such calculation of the duration of calls as detailed in (i) through (iv) included, “Chargeable Time”). TalkChief may change the Per-Minute Rates at any time without notice. Customer may request the Per-Minute Rates currently applicable by sending a request to sales@TalkChief.io.</p>
            <p>The Services shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>
            <p>a) Outbound calls made by Customer with a local/toll-free phone to countries outside of the European Union will incur Usage Fees; b) inbound calls to Customer are free regardless of whether they come from a foreign country or not, provided they are made to a local or geographic telephone number (non-toll-free); c) all inbound calls on a toll-free phone line shall incur Usage Fees; d) any internal calls or communications (including but not limited to calls, voicemail deposits and call transfers) between Users, or between a User and an Administrator, shall be free of charge provided such </p>
            <p>calls have been made using the Services; e) outbound calls for which TalkChief receives answer supervision (i.e. connecting time) including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one (1) minute of Chargeable Time (answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment); f) calls forwarded to mobile phones or landlines shall be deemed outbound calls and shall incur Usage Fees including in the event Customer has purchased an unlimited outgoing/incoming call bundle, at the then applicable rate; and g) calls received by Customer from a third party using a local/toll-free phone line which call is subsequently forwarded or transferred shall be deemed to be the same call.</p>
            <p>7.4 Payment. By providing a valid credit or debit card information and/or bank account information (“Payment Method”), Customer expressly: (i) authorizes TalkChief and/or any other company or individual acting as TalkChief’s billing agent to charge the Payment Method: (x) monthly for fees corresponding to the Usage Fees; at the billing frequency chosen and specified by Customer on the relevant Order Form or Purchase, as applicable, for fees corresponding to Fixed Fees (the “Billing Frequency”); and (z) for any and all other fees in connection with the Services including recurring payments billed on a monthly or annual basis and and to continue attempting to charge and/or place holds on such Customer’s Payment Method until such amounts are paid in full; (ii) agrees to update such Payment Method from time to time as necessary; and (iii) acknowledges and agrees that TalkChief shall not be liable for any expired credit/debit card, insufficient funds or other charges Customer incurred as a result of such attempts to charge, and/or place holds on, such Payment Method. In the event Customer selects a Plan that includes a predetermined allotment of services, unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such Plan, any unused allotment of such services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any future billing cycle.</p>
            <p>7.5 Taxes. The Fees are exclusive of VAT (where applicable), costs/disbursements, charges, or any other duties, levies, registration fees or taxes which shall be charged additionally. The invoiced amount and/or amounts charged to the Payment Method may hence fluctuate from month to month and Customer agree to pay all fees and/or taxes due.</p>
